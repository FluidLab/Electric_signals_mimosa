Supplementary Information for the Master thesis "Electrophysiology of Mimosa pudica" (M.Labiausse, 2024)
Code for running simulations of electrical signals in plants (mimosa pudica). 

pyHH_plants_single_cell = Basic model of a plant single plant cell (adapted from the works of Gradmann, 1993 and 1998).
pyHHH_plants_propagation = Simulation of a line of plant cells in order to study plant propagation (inconclusive).
pyHH_single_cell_calcium = Model of a single plant cell, with addition of calcium channel.
pyHH_single_cell_light = Model of a single plant cell responsive to light
Simu = Overkill simulation based on the works of Sukhova et al (2009,2011, 2017).
Simulation_functions = Functions for running "Simu".
Run_HH_sium = Code for running "pyHH_plants_single_cell", "pyHHH_plants_propagation", and "pyHH_single_cell_calcium".
run_HH_light = Code for running "pyHH_single_cell_light".
run_simu = Code for running "Simu".
